        <p>A URL, colloquially termed a web address,[1] is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.</p>
        <p>Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar. A typical URL could have the form http://www.example.com/index.html, which indicates a protocol (http), a hostname (www.example.com), and a file name (index.html).</p>

        <h2>Web Server</h2>
        <p>A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client requests on the World Wide Web. It can contain one or more websites</p>
        <p>Function to store, process and deliver web pages to clients</p>

        <h2>Web Browser</h2>
        <p>A web browser is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>The purpose is to fetch information resources from the Web and display them on a user's interface</p>
        <p>The function: This process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), such as https://en.wikipedia.org/, into the browser. Most browsers use an internal cache of web page resources to improve loading times for subsequent visits to the same page. </p>

        <br><b>DOCTYPE: </b>It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. It is not case sensitive

        <br><b>EM: </b>The text inside will get displayed it <em>italic</em>.

        <h2>Head-element</h2>
        <p>The < head > element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the < html > tag and the < body > tag. Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.</p>

        <h2>HTML-element</h2>
        <p>The < html > tag represents the root of an HTML document. The < html > tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).</p>

        <h2>strong-element</h2>

        <p>The < title > tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.</p>

        <br /><b>HTML Headings:</b> HTML headings are defined with the < h1> to < h6> tags.(< h1> < /h1>)
        <br /><b>HTML Links:</b>HTML links are defined with the < a>tag:< a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link< /a>
        <p><b>HTML Paragraphs:</b>HTML paragraphs are defined with the < p> tag:< p>This is a paragraph.< /p></p>
        <p><b>HTML Images:</b>HTML images are defined with the < img> tag.The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:< img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142"></p>
        <p>The < img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.</p>
        <p><b>Images in Another Folder:If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute(< img src="/images/html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></b></p>
        <p><b>Images on Another Server/Website:</b>Some web sites points to an external image on another server.To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:< img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com"></p>

        <p>HTML Elements:An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:< h1 Start Tag >My First Heading Content < /h1 Endtag> </p>

        <h2>How are resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web?</h2>
      <p>
        A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), termed a web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other.
        Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar.
        <p>They are addressed with URLs</p>
      </p>

        <h2>What is a web server?</h2>
      <p>
        A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client requests on the World Wide Web.

        <h2>What does a web server?</h2>
      <p>
        The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.
      </p>

        <h2>How can content be stored on a web server?</h2>
      <p>
        A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols. The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content.
     </p>

        <h2>How is content in webpages described?</h2>
      <p>
        Web content is the textual, visual, or aural content that is encountered as part of the user experience on websites. It may include—among other things—text, images, sounds, videos, and animations.

      <h1>Week 2</h1>
      <h1>Html-Part</h1>

      <h2>Name the components of html elements properly</h2>
      <p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. The HTML document itself begins with < html> and ends with < /html>. The visible part of the HTML document is between < body> and < /body>.</p>

      <h2>Identify void elements and how they are denoted</h2>
      <p>Void elemnts don't have an endtag. Empty Elements (< br />)</p>

      <h2>Identify attributes</h2>
      <p>->All HTML elemts can have attributes</p>
      <p>->Attributes provide additional information about elements</p>
      <p>->Attributes are always specified in <strong>the start tag</strong></p>
      <p>->Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: <strong>name="value"</strong></p>

      <p>The href Attribute: The < a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:</p>

      <p>The src Attribute:The < img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:< img src="img_girl.jpg"></p>
      <p>There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src= "https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".</p>
      <p>2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".</p>
      <p>Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.</p>

      <p>The width and height Attributes:The < img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels):< img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600"></p>

      <p>The alt Attribute:The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.(< img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket")></p>

      <p>The style Attribute:The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.(< p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.< /p>)</p>

      <p>The lang Attribute:You should always include the lang attribute inside the < html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.</p>
      <p>The title Attribute:The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.(< p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>

      <p>All HTML elements can have attributes</p>
      <p>< a > specifies the URL of the page the link goes to</p>
      <p>The src attribute of < img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed</p>
      <p>The width and height attributes of < img> provide size information for images</p>
      <p>The alt attribute of < img> provides an alternate text for an image</p>
      <p>The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more</p>
      <p>The lang attribute of the < html> tag declares the language of the Web page</p>
      <p>The title attribute defines some extra information about an element</p>

      <p>The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element. By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element. The background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.</p>
      <p>The background-position property is used to specify the position of the background image.</p>

      <h2>Pseudo classes for the < a > element</h2>
      <p>A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.</p>
      <p>It can be used to: Style an element when a user mouses over it, style visited and unvisited links differently, style an element when it gets focus</p>
      <p>a:link {color: #FF0000;} (for an unused link ex. blue, for used link ex. purple)</p>

      <h2>Identify the difference between serif and sans-serif fonts</h2>
      <p>Serif: Serif fonts have small lines at the ends on some characters (.serif)</p>
